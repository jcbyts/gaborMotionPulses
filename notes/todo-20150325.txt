# Fits

* one thing to note: Yneg is basically across-the-board (in good fits) positively correlated with the residual spikes, Y-Ypos, suggesting that overall spikes predicted to negative components really do tend to raise the actual spike rate.
* also, this correlation increases with |wneg|/|wpos|, meaning that the larger |wneg| is proprtional to |wpos|, the more correlated Ypos is with Y-Yneg
	- sweet spot around wrat=0.5: corr(Yneg, Y-Ypos) is maximized, around 0.5

# Cells

stim.dirprob == 0
plot Ypos vs Yneg on those, with choice colored

colormap of Y, e.g. more saturated means more spikes
or maybe Y is 3rd dimension

## 20140305-2, 20140304-13

* slant in X-Y-Z when Ypos > 0 suggests suppressive surround (given fixed Ypos, Yneg modulates cell's overall response)

## 20140517-8, 20140218-1

* slant like above only for Ypos < 0 and Ypos > 0

## 20140304-1

* view by dirprob==0, still looks the same
