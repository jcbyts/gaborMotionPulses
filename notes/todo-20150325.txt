stim.dirprob == 0
plot Ypos vs Yneg on those, with choice colored

colormap of Y, e.g. more saturated means more spikes
or maybe Y is 3rd dimension

# Cells

## 20140305-2, 20140304-13

* slant in X-Y-Z when Ypos > 0 suggests suppressive surround (given fixed Ypos, Yneg modulates cell's overall response)

## 20140517-8, 20140218-1

* slant like above only for Ypos < 0 and Ypos > 0

## 20140304-1

* view by dirprob==0, still looks the same
