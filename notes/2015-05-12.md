## Paper approach

Journal: J Neurosci

Focus: a methods paper showing a proof-of-concept. The way we typically do experiments and classify cells is to ignore their surround, center the stimulus on the RF, and measure one cell at a time. Also, we just count total spikes and ignore the temporal component. But the brain doesn't do this; it has multiple cells, and the stimulus hits them all separately. So when you record from multiple cells at once, you need to classify how well and where the stimulus is driving each cell.

### Overview

We apply this high-dimensional method for three types:

* MT - stimulus-driven (dots in RF)
* LIP - stimulus-driven (dots in RF)
* LIP - task-driven (target in RF)

### Outline

* use MT as the more mechanical type, to establish trust in the method
* now apply to LIP, where we have less expectations
* look at temporal components
* separability analysis (comparing LIP-stim-driven vs. LIP-task-driven?)
* maybe suggest extension to decision with logistic?

## To do:

* label all cells as one of these classes
    - also include things like: classic MT, MT with surrounds/edge, shitty MT
* find best examples of each class
* create figures to explain methods
* start writing by collecting all good figures
* get relevant papers / points of novelty
    - two Sahani/Linden papers
    - Krekelberg
    - Ahrens context modulation in auditory using multi-linear regression [for form of paper]
* adapt to use Pillow's code to do evidence optimization for gaussian
* laplace approximation (sqrt of diagonal of hessian) to get error-bars on fits
